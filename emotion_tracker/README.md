# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Emotions

- ***EmotionButtons*** is a component for creating the buttons in the main view (***EmotionButtonView***).

### Sub-emotions

- ***SubEmotionButtons*** is a component where the sub-emotion buttons are created.
    - Is a child component of ***SubEmotions***

## Utils

- ***CalculateDistance*** contains a function using the *Haversine formula*. It takes in ***longitude*** and ***latitude*** values and it calculates the distance between the given longitude and latitude with the longitude and latitude of Nokia HQ. It is used for location functionality, checking if the user is <1.5km from the Nokia HQ building.
- ***TimerFunctions*** contains ***timerStart*** and ***timerTick*** functions which are used to start a timer after the user clicks an emotion button on the main page. The time and how long the user needs to wait after clicking the button can be changed in ***Emotions*** component by changing the millisecond value of the ***timerTimeMs*** variable.

## Statistics

    - ***Linechart*** (main emotions)
    - ***Mountainchart*** (shows percentage)
    - ***Piechart*** (not in use but can be easily implemented)
- All charts are child components of the ***AllCharts*** parent component. The ***AllCharts*** component is a child component of the ***StatWindow*** view.
- All charts can display data from
    - ***a day***
        - The doughnut chart has an hour range slider and single hour slider
            - ***HourSlider*** is a parent component for ***HourRange*** component
            - data is fetched within a certain hour range or from a specific hour (i.e. 9:00-15:00 or 14:00)
    - ***a week***
    - ***a month***
    - ***a year***
    - ***a decade***

## Location

- User‚Äôs location is checked by using ***************Geolocated*************** library.
- ***Geolocated*** library is used in ***App***
    - If user‚Äôs browser does not support Geolocated library, the page renders *Your browser does not support Geolocation* text.
    - If user‚Äôs browser supports the library then the app will ask for a permission to use the location.
        - If user denies the access for the location the app renders ************************************************************DisabledLocationView************************************************************
        - If access is granted the app checks the latitude and longitude of the user and the ******************************************************CalculateDistance****************************************************** function calculates if the user is <1.5km away from Nokia HQ building.
            - If user is >1.5k away from Nokia HQ building the app renders ******************************************TooFarAwayView******************************************
            - If user is <1.5km away from Nokia HQ building the app renders ***************************************************EmotionButtonView***************************************************
- While we wait for the permission to use the location the app renders ************************Loading************************ view.

- Own view for tablet (in front of the tree installation)
- Has own *URL* and **path is found in ***App.***
- Contains only main emotion buttons, no sub-emotions.
- Does not have a timer.
- Does not offer statistics view.
